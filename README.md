# Alpha Kappa Psi - Psi Upsilon: Paws for a Cause Website

Every April, the Psi Upsilon Chapter of Alpha Kappa Psi hosts their annual Philanthropy week at UC Merced titled "Paws for a Cause!" This is a week long series of events where a bunch of organizations raise money for New Beginnings for Merced County Animals!

I coded from scratch a [website](https://akpsipawsforacause.com) that everyone participating could access using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website includes a leaderboard where people could see how many points each organization had, links to our philanthropy & shirt sale, and images displaying our Top Dawg nominees!
